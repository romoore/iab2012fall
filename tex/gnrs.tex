The Global Name Resolution Service (GNRS) is a critical portion of the
Mobility First (MF) Future Internet Architecture (FIA). Providing sub-second
insert and retrieval of Globally Unique IDentifier (GUIDs) bindings enables
network support of highly mobile devices, content, and information contexts.
% TODO: This is placeholding junk.
blah, blah, blah, FIa is great and GNRS is important. We made it better by
throwing away a bunch of junk and making stuff more modular. Expand here and
make the words good.

\section{Introduction}
GNRS provides a distributed, redundant storage network for
GUID$\rightarrow$Network Address (NA) binding values.  By utilizing the latest
secure hashing algorithms and replicating across multiple autonomous systems,
we are able to scale the system to tens of thousands of nodes.  

The server provides the basic functionality of the GNRS, being both the point
of access and the storage node for the system.  Clients contact one or more
``access'' servers (configured during network attachment) to insert bindings
for their own GUID values, or to retrieve bindings for the GUID values found
in application contexts.
\subsection{Our Contribution}
As a research prototype, the GNRS server is written to be modular, extensible,
and configurable, and yet retains good real-world performance.  Simple
software interfaces connect the different components, allowing each to be
replaced or reconfigured independently of one another.
\subsection{Related Work}
The previous version of the server was a patchwork of last-minute rush jobs
and ``one-off'' contributions intended to be temporary, but which resulted in
an discordant mish-mosh of spaghetti code.  Due to a combination of unexpected
side-effects and undocumented functionality, the code had to be refactored.

After an in-depth and thorough review of the existing source, it was decided
that a new design, built ``from scratch'' was the best solution -- trying to
fix the existing code piecemeal would lead to higher numbers of bugs and a
longer development cycle. 
\section{Technical Approach}
The new server has been written in Java to provide a hardware- and operating
system-agnostic implementation.  Wherever possible, standard libraries are
utilized to provide the required functionality, and only the application logic
needed to be written by hand.

The server is organized into several individual modules: network access, GUID
mapping, persistent storage, and application logic.  The application logic
serves as a central point of coordination within the framework of the GNRS
server d$\ae$mon.

The network access component ensures that the GNRS server is able to operate
over any networking layer/technology without changes to the core code.  This
replaceable component currently supports IPv4 and will be written for MF
routing in the near future.

The GUID mapping module, relying partly on a networking implementation,
enables the server to determine the remote GNRS hosts responsible for
maintaining the current bindings of GUID values.

Persistent storage is handled indepednently from the rest of the server and
exposes only a very simple interface, mapping to the application messages
available in the protocol.  Currently, a BerkeleyDB provides both in-memory
and on-disk storage for GUID bindings.  In the future we will explore external
databases, NoSQL data stores, and other possibilities.

\section{Summary of Results}
The new iteration of the server provides a more flexible, configurable way for
GNRS deployments to be tested and deployed. Focusing on the future, we will be
deploying to both the GENI and Orbit testbed frameworks to perform large-scale
performance measurements and load analysis.
